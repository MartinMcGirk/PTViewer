# PTViewer
Will hopefully make viewing pivotal tracker ticket dependencies a bit less painful.

The idea is to be able to read info on all our product and engineering stories, and then graph them out so we can more easily see what stories are blocked by other stories, and map dependencies between them.

Currently doesn't do an awful lot. It reads the data, and writes to a json file. The next step will be to graph out the data and make it pretty.
